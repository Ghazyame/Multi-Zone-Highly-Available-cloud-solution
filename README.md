# ☁️ Multi-Zone High Availability Cloud Solution on AWS

This project demonstrates the design, deployment, and validation of a highly available cloud infrastructure using **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It features fault tolerance, resilience, and cost-aware architecture across multiple availability zones.

## ⚙️ Infrastructure Overview

This project uses **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) via **AWS CloudFormation** to deploy:
- Multi-zone EC2 instances
- Public subnets across AZs
- Application Load Balancer
- Route 53 DNS failover
- Auto Scaling Group
- Security Groups and Internet Gateway

📄 CloudFormation template: `cloudformation/Frankfurt Region.yaml` `cloudformation/Paris Region.yaml`

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

Two test cases were conducted to validate availability:
1. **Active-Active Architecture**
   - EC2 failure simulated in one AZ
   - Load balancer redirects traffic automatically
2. **Active-Passive Architecture**
   - Primary instance failure triggers Route 53 DNS failover to standby

🎬 Demo videos included in the Google Drive link.

## 📊 Cost Analysis

| Architecture     | Availability        | Monthly Cost (Est.) |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Active-Active    | Real-time failover  | ~$270                |
| Active-Passive   | DNS failover        | ~$33                 |
