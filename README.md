This repository contains my Bachelor Thesis project for the Computer Engineering & Software Systems Department at Ain Shams University.

## 📄 Thesis
You can find the thesis PDF under `/thesis`:
- **Title:** Multi-Zone High Availability Cloud Solution
- **Author:** Abdelrahman Mohamed Ghazy
- **Supervisor:** Dr. Wagdy Anis Aziz
- **Date:** June 2025

## 🚀 Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a fault-tolerant multi-zone cloud architecture using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It explores:
- Active-Active and Active-Passive configurations
- Cost vs. availability trade-offs
- Infrastructure as Code using CloudFormation
- Monitoring with CloudWatch
- Testing & Failover scenarios

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- AWS EC2, ELB, Route 53, CloudWatch, CloudFormation
- YAML for infrastructure as code
- Amazon CloudFront for content delivery

## 📊 Cost Analysis
Detailed cost comparisons between:
- Active-Active (💰 High cost, high availability)
- Active-Passive (💸 Cost-effective, delayed failover)
